We then match the airflow capability with a high-lift,&nbsp;hydraulic roller camshaft that delivers great idle quality and requires no&nbsp;periodic lash adjustments.<br /><br />Our crate engine package includes the ZZ454/440 assembled with a&nbsp;water pump, balancer, aluminum intake manifold and a 14-inch flexplate.&nbsp;Your Chevrolet Performance dealer can hook you up with the carburetor,&nbsp;starter, ignition system and other accessories required to get this big power&nbsp;Big-Block started.</p> <p><strong>ZZ454 TECH SPECS<br /></strong>Part Number: 12498777<br /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" style=""float: right;"" title=""12498777-dyno.jpg"" src=""http://edrinkeperformance.com/product_images/uploaded_images/12498777-dyno.jpg"" alt=""12498777-dyno.jpg"" width=""450"" height=""228"" />Engine Type: Chevy Big Block V8<br />Displacement (cu in): 454<br />Bore x Stroke (in): 4.250 x 4.000<br />Block (P/N 19170538): Cast Iron with 4-Bolt Main Caps<br />Crankshaft (P/N 14096983): Forged Steel<br />Connecting Rods (P/N 19170198): Forged Steel<br />Pistons (P/N 10215228): Forged Aluminum<br />Camshaft Type (P/N 24502611): Hydraulic Roller<br />Camshaft Lift (in): .510 Intake / .540 Exhaust<br />Camshaft Duration (@.050 in): 211&deg; *Intake / 230&deg; Exhaust<br />Cylinder Heads (P/N 12363392): Aluminum Oval Port; 110cc Chambers<br />Valve Size (in): 2.190 Intake / 1.880 Exhaust<br />Compression Ratio: 9.6:1<br />Rocker Arms (P/N 12368082): Stamped Steel<br />Rocker Arm Ratio: 1.7:1<br />Water Pump (P/N 19168606): Cast Iron, Long Style<br />Flexplate (P/N 10185034): 14""<br />Recommended Fuel: 92 Octane<br />Ignition Timing: Base 4&deg; BTDC, 26&deg; Total<br />Maximum Recommended Rpm: 5,500<br />Balanced: External</p> <p><strong>INSTALLATION NOTES<br /></strong></p> <ul> <li>Requires addition of carburetor, starter,&nbsp;distributor and ignition system (not included)</li> <li>Clutch linkage bosses are now drilled and tapped.&nbsp;When using cast-iron exhaust manifolds, lower&nbsp;head bolts may need to be replaced with bolts with&nbsp;shorter heads, for clearance</li> <li>Comes with an externally balanced 14"" automatic&nbsp;transmission flexplate; use flywheel P/N 14096987&nbsp;and 11"" clutch assembly for manual transmission&nbsp;applications</li> <li>Designed for pre-1976 street vehicles or any&nbsp;off-road vehicle</li> <li>Not intended for marine applications</li> </ul> <p><a href=""http://edrinkeperformance.com/content/12498777-Warranty-PDF.pdf"" target=""_blank"">ZZ454 Warranty Detail PDF</a></p>","6,753.47",6604.86,"7,964.00",6375,0,Y,,615,31.5,33.5,39.8,Y,Y,Y,none,0,0,Engines/Big Block Crate Engines;Big-Block Engines & Components/Big-Block Crate Engines,,,,,449,u/524/12498777__05307.jpg,"454 ENGINE ASM, W/ALUM.

That raspy rat engine was rated at 480 horsepower, although the figure was generally thought to be on the conservative side.</p> <p>Chevrolet Performance has recreated that classic Big-Block combination in the Z427/480 &mdash; including the 480 horsepower rating (and it just might be a little on the conservative side, too). Like the original, it features a forged steel crankshaft and high-flow, oval-port aluminum cylinder heads. We&rsquo;ve upgraded the camshaft from the original&rsquo;s mechanical flat-tappet design to a smoother hydraulic roller, which delivers great drivability characteristics and a broader rev range. A 10.1:1 compression ratio means it will perform great on pump gas, too.</p> <p>Whether you&rsquo;re building a &rsquo;69 COPO Camaro resto-mod tribute, a modified mid-year Corvette, or a street-tire class winner, the ZZ427/480 is the heritage-inspired crate engine that delivers the performance that built the Big-Block&rsquo;s legendary reputation.</p> <p><strong>ZZ427/480 TECH SPECS<br /></strong>Part Number:19166393<br /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" style=""float: right;"" title=""19166393-dyno.jpg"" src=""http://edrinkeperformance.com/product_images/uploaded_images/19166393-dyno.jpg"" alt=""19166393-dyno.jpg"" width=""450"" height=""228"" />Engine Type:&nbsp;Chevy Big Block V8<br />Displacement (cu. in.):&nbsp;427<br />Bore x Stroke (in.):&nbsp;4.250 x 3.750<br />Block (P/N 19170538):&nbsp;Cast Iron with 4-Bolt Main Caps<br />Crankshaft (P/N 19171620):&nbsp;Forged Steel<br />Connecting Rods (P/N 19211226):&nbsp;Forged Steel<br />Pistons (P/N 19171618):&nbsp;Forged Aluminum<br />Camshaft Type (P/N 12366543):&nbsp;Hydraulic Roller<br />Camshaft Lift (in.):&nbsp;.527 Intake / .544 Exhaust<br />Camshaft Duration (@.050 in.):&nbsp;224&deg; Intake / 234&deg; Exhaust<br />Cylinder Heads (P/N 19211799):&nbsp;Aluminum Oval Port, 110-cc Chambers<br />Balanced:&nbsp;Internal<br />Valve Size (in.):&nbsp;2.190 Intake / 1.880 Exhaust<br />Compression Ratio:&nbsp;10.1:1<br />Rocker Arms (P/N 19210726):&nbsp;Aluminum Roller Style<br />Rocker Arm Ratio:&nbsp;1.7:1<br />Distributor (P/N 19212081):&nbsp;HEI Type<br />Carburetor (P/N 19170093):&nbsp;770-cfm<br />Water Pump (P/N 19168602):&nbsp;Aluminum Short Style<br />Spark Plugs and Wires:&nbsp;Included|<br />Flexplate (P/N 12561217):&nbsp;14""<br />Recommended Fuel:&nbsp;92 Octane<br />Ignition Timing:&nbsp;Base 10&deg; BTDC, 36&deg; Total<br />Maximum Recommended rpm:&nbsp;6400</p> <p><strong>INSTALLATION NOTES</strong></p> <ul> <li>Due to crate fitment, the carburetor is shipped&nbsp;in a separate box and needs to be installed by an&nbsp;engine installer</li> <li>Requires addition of starter and fuel pump&nbsp;(not included)</li> <li>Clutch linkage bosses are drilled and tapped.&nbsp;When using cast-iron exhaust manifolds, lower&nbsp;head bolts may need to be replaced with bolts&nbsp;with shorter heads for clearance</li> <li>Comes with an internally balanced 14"" automatic&nbsp;transmission flexplate.

The answer is 525 horsepower in&nbsp;one of our most powerful production-based crate engines. We call it the&nbsp;LS376/525 and if take-no-prisoner performance is what you&rsquo;re looking&nbsp;for in your new Camaro or resto-mod Chevelle, this is it!</p> <p>The ASA camshaft is a hydraulic roller with .525-inch lift on both sides,&nbsp;along with 226 degrees duration on the intake side and 236 degrees&nbsp;on the exhaust side. Coupled with a tight, 110-degree lobe separation&nbsp;angle, it helps the engine deliver excellent throttle response and breathe&nbsp;exceptionally well at high rpm. And for durability, we complement the<br />cam with higher-rate valve springs.</p> <p>You&rsquo;ll need tuning to make the most of the engine in a late-model GM&nbsp;vehicle. If you plan to use the LS376/525 in a vintage car, you&rsquo;ll need&nbsp;controller kit P/N 19259261, which includes the throttle pedal to match&nbsp;its electronically controlled throttle body.

With its four bolt main block, nodular iron crankshaft, PM steel connecting rods and light but strong cast aluminum pistons, this engine screams durability. <br />Add to the strong foundation a pair of 64cc Vortec cast iron cylinder heads and a dual pattern camshaft with just a bit of a ""lumpy"" idle, and you've got the muscle car small block that you've been looking for. <br /><br />Dressed to impress with chrome valve covers and timing cover, this engine will look great between the fenders of your favorite street rod, muscle car or grass roots racer. The cylinder heads on this great little performer use 1.94"" intake and 1.50"" exhaust valves that are sprung with 1999 Corvette L3I valve springs. The 64cc chambers yield a healthy, but streetable 9.1 to 1 compression ratio. The cam is a modern dual pattern interpretation of the old '65 to '67 Corvette 327 cam. But with more lift and duration on the exhaust side, it does a better job of clearing exhaust from the combustion chamber.<br /><br /> We also decreased duration and lift ever so slightly on the intake side to build more cylinder pressure. The result is a cam that makes great torque and horsepower with the 350 HO's 9.1 to 1 compression ratio.<br /> Add the new dual plane intake manifold P/N 12496820, 600 cfm carburetor, HEI distributor, torsional damper, water pump and exhaust manifolds or headers and you've got an outstanding muscle motor with a broad, smooth torque curve and an honest 330 horsepower. This manifold has four bolts, not six, to attach it to the cylinder head. Older six-bolt manifolds will not fit the new Vortec heads.<br /> The 350 HO is not intended for marine use, and should only be used in 1975 and earlier pre-emissions street vehicles or any year off road vehicles</p> <p>All the same, important, powerbuilding&nbsp;elements as the Turn-Key&nbsp;and Deluxe versions, but it comes&nbsp;without an intake manifold, carburetor&nbsp;or distributor.</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>350 HO&nbsp;Base</strong><strong> Specs.</strong></p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Engine Type: Chevy Small Block V8<br />Weight:&nbsp;575<br />Horse Power:&nbsp;330<br />Torque:&nbsp;380<br />Displacement (cu in): 350<br />Bore x Stroke (in): 4.000 x 3.480<br />Block (P/N 10105123): Cast-iron with 4-bolt Main Caps<br />Crankshaft (P/N 14088526): Nodular Iron<br />Connecting Rods (P/N 10108688): Powdered Metal Steel<br />Pistons (P/N 12514101): Cast Aluminum<br />Camshaft Type (P/N 24502476): Hydraulic Flat Tappet<br />Camshaft Lift (in): .435 intake / .460 Exhaust<br />Camshaft Duration (@.050 in): 212&deg; Intake / 222&deg; Exhaust<br />Cylinder Heads (P/N 12558060): Vortec Iron; 64cc Chambers<br />Valve Size (in): 1.940 intake / 1.500 Exhaust<br />Compression Ratio: 9.1 Nominal<br />Rocker Arms (P/N 10089648): Stamped Steel<br />Rocker Arm Ratio: 1.5:1<br />Water Pump (P/N 88894341): Cast Iron, long Style<br />Flexplate (P/N 14088765): 12.750""<br />Recommended Fuel: 92 Octane<br />Ignition Timing: Base 10&deg; BTDC, 32&deg; Total<br />Maximum Recommended rpm: 5,500<br />Balanced: External</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">&nbsp;</p> <p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://edrinkeperformance.com/content/19210007-Warranty-PDF.pdf"">350 HO Base Warranty Detail PDF</a></span></em></p>","3,201.51",3161.98,"3,775.36",3075,0,Y,,425,22,30,30,Y,Y,Y,none,0,0,Engines/Small Block Crate Engines;Small-Block Crate Engines & Components/Small-Block Crate Engines,,,,,515,h/152/19210007__62784.jpg,"ENGINE ASM,350CID/330HP VORTEC HEADS",Y,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,0,0,2,Default Tax Class,,N,/engine-asm-350cid-330hp-with-vortec-heads/19210007,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,

The front rotors are 14 inches wide, compared to the 12.6-inch diameter of the V-6 brakes, while the rear rotors are 14.4 inches wide, compared to the stock 12.4-inch rotors. The SS calipers are aluminum Brembo four-piston units for each corner. It&rsquo;s a more economical option for customers who want greater brake performance on the street and track, but don&rsquo;t need the performance of the ZL1 brakes.

Product,535,SS V-8 Camaro to ZL1 Brembo Front  Brake Conversion Kit,P,22959672,1,Camaro,,Right,"<p>Upgrade the front brakes on your 2010-and-later Camaro SS with the larger brakes from the supercharged Camaro ZL1 &ndash; including racing-style two-piece, 14.6-inch front rotors and six-piston Brembo aluminum calipers, in black with the ZL1 logo. That compares with the 14-inch rotors/four-piston calipers on SS models.&nbsp;The ZL1 two-piece rotors offer greater resistance to warping and potentially longer rotor life, as well as reduced weight. The design features a separate cast iron rotor brake ring mounted to an aluminum &ldquo;hat&rdquo; that attaches the brake assembly to the wheel hub. The hat and brake ring cool at different rates, which helps the rotor dissipate heat more effectively. This racing-style disc design enhances braking performance under track operating conditions. Kit includes two rotors, two calipers, pads and mounting hardware. <br />Add the optional ZL1 rear caliper kit, P/N 23104466, to complement the style of the ZL1 front caliper. <br />NOTE: Requires 20"" wheels for caliper clearance.<br />*For V-6 Conversion use Complete Kit P/N 22989384 (front and rear)</p> <p>The system includes:<br />part number Detail QtY<br />22960684 Front Installation Sheet 1<br />20795300 ZL1 Front LH Rotor 1<br />20944529 ZL1 SPO Front LH Caliper 1<br />20944530 ZL1 SPO Front RH Caliper 1<br />25940448 SPO Front Caliper Pin Kit 2<br />25940447 SPO Front Service Pad Kit 1<br />20944523 ZL1 Front LH Hose 1<br />20944532 ZL1 Front LH Shield 1<br />20795302 ZL1 Front RH Rotor 1<br />20944522 ZL1 Front RH Hose 1<br />20944531 ZL1 Front RH Shield 1<br />11570788 Caliper to Knuckle Bolts 4<br />11569590 Front &amp; Rear Hose Bolts 2<br />21012386 Front &amp; Rear Hose Washers 4<br />22942442 Chevrolet Perf.

This kit features the specialty components from&nbsp;the production Camaro ZL1, including a larger, stronger 9.9-inch cast iron&nbsp;differential housing, stronger axles and heavy-duty limited-slip differential.&nbsp;This patent-pending system is designed to ensure that ZL1's tremendous&nbsp;power is delivered smoothly to the ground. A rear-differential cooler is incorporated&nbsp;and reduces temperatures in the differential by more than 100&deg; F (fluid&nbsp;lines must be installed). Asymmetrical half-shafts &ndash; a 60mm hollow shaft on&nbsp;the right and a 33mm solid shaft on the left &ndash; offer different torsional stiffness&nbsp;rates, which work with the limited-slip differential to minimize the chance of&nbsp;wheel hop on hard launches.

Stage 2 takes your Cobalt SS or ION Red Line from&nbsp;a stock rating of 205 horsepower all the way up to 241 horsepower.&nbsp;The key to making that power is increasing the boost on the factory supercharger&nbsp;by swapping out the stock blower pulley.

For best<br />power, we recommend also installing a high-flow exhaust.&nbsp;This PCM is equipped with a user-adjustable rev limit from 6,750 to 8,000&nbsp;rpm. The rev limit is adjusted by pressing on the throttle pedal with the&nbsp;ignition on and engine off. At about 50 percent throttle, the tachometer&nbsp;will show the current rev limit. Pressing the throttle further will adjust the&nbsp;rev limit in 250 rpm increments. This PCM is also equipped with a control&nbsp;scheme for the equivalent of a 50-horsepower shot of nitrous. The PCM&nbsp;will automatically provide the proper spark and fuel for nitrous up to 500&nbsp;rpm below the current selected rev limit when the trigger is activated.</p> <p>Note : The Stage 3 Kit is for off-road use only. The Stage 3 upgrades are&nbsp;meant for off-road use only and are not certified to be emissions-legal.&nbsp;The vehicle&rsquo;s air conditioning is disabled by the Stage 3 PCM.</p> <p>Note : This kit is an upgrade to Stage 2. It requires the following parts from&nbsp;the Stage 2 Kit: high-flow fuel injectors, pulley adapter hub and serpentine belt.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",642.44,634.52,757.60,0,0,N,,0.47,12.3,10.3,13.6,Y,Y,Y,none,0,0,Other Engines & Platforms/Superchargers,,,,,1620,h/212/88958717__05404.jpg,,Y,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,0,0,2,Default Tax Class,,N,/stage-3-kit-2006-2007-ion-red-line/88958717,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,

This Base crate engine kit includes the intake manifold, distributor,</p> <p align=""LEFT"">&nbsp;water pump, damper and flexplate &ndash; and the distinctive, racing-inspired valve covers that distinguish this crate</p> <p align=""LEFT"">&nbsp;engine as the latest in the ZZ legacy!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>SP350/375 Base Tech specs </strong></p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Engine Type: Chevy Small Block V8</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Weight:&nbsp;410</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Horse Power:&nbsp;405</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Torque:&nbsp;405</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Displacement (cu in): 350</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Bore x Stroke (in): 4.000 x 3.480</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Block (P/N 10105123):</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Cast-iron with 4-bolt main caps</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Crankshaft (P/N 12556307): Forged Steel</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Connecting Rods (P/N 10108688): Powdered Metal</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Pistons (P/N 10159436): Hypereutectic Aluminum</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Camshaft Type (P/N 10185071): Hydraulic Roller</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Camshaft Lift (in): .474 intake / .510 Exhaust</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Camshaft Duration (@.050 in): 208&deg; Intake / 221&deg; Exhaust</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Cylinder Heads (P/N 19300955): Fast Burn Aluminum;&nbsp;62cc Chambers</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Valve Size (in): 2.000 intake / 1.550 Exhaust</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Compression Ratio: 9.72:1 Nominal</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Rocker Arms (P/N 19210724): Aluminum roller style</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Rocker Arm Ratio: 1.5:1</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Recommended Fuel: 93 Octane</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Ignition Timing:&nbsp;36&deg; Total at 4,000 rpm</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Maximum Recommended rpm: 5,800</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Balanced: External</p> <p><strong>INSTALLATION NOTES</strong></p> <ul> <li>Comes with 12.750 externally balanced 153-tooth&nbsp;automatic transmission flexplate.
